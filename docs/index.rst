Welcome to distlib's documentation!
===================================

Welcome to the documentation for ``distlib``, a low-level library of packaging
functionality which is intended to be used as the basis for third-party
packaging tools. Using a common low-level layer will improve interoperability
and consistency of user experience across those tools which use the library.

**Please note:** this documentation is *work in progress*.
